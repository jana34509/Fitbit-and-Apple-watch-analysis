# Fitbit-and-Apple-watch-analysis
The objective of this study was to examine whether commercial wearable devices could accurately predict lying, sitting, and different physical activity intensity in a lab based protocol. Methods We recruited a convenience sample of 46 participants (26 women) to wear three devices, a GENEActiv, and Apple Watch Series 2, a Fitbit Charge HR2. Participants completed a 65-minute protocol with 40-minutes of total treadmill time and 25-minutes of sitting or lying time. Indirect calorimetry was used to measure energy expenditure. The outcome variable for the study was the activity class; lying, sitting, walking self-paced, 3 METS, 5 METS, and 7 METS. Minute-by-minute heart rate, steps, distance, and calories from Apple Watch and Fitbit were included in four different machine learning models.
